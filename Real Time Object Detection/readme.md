## Real-Time-Object-Detection...

Idea : Real-time object detection and tracking is a vast, vibrant yet inconclusive and complex area of computer vision. Due to its increased 
utilization in surveillance, tracking system used in security and many others applications have propelled researchers to continuously 
devise more efficient and competitive algorithms.However, problems emerge in implementing object detection and tracking in real-time; 
such as tracking under dynamic environment, expensive computation to fit the real-time performance, or multi-camera multi-objects 
tracking make this task strenuously difficult. Though, many methods and techniques have been developed, but in this literature review 
we have discussed some famous and basic methods of object detection and tracking. 


## Prerequisites : 
 
     Python 3.5
     OpenCV
     install tensorflow 1.6
     
     
## Procedure:
     
      Download python 3.5 and install it. Use command prompt to install pip and then use
   pip to install tensorflow(pip install tensorflow) and also install some required packages
   for this program such as opencv,numpy,argparse.

    Numpy - Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and 
            basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays.

    Argparse â€“ Command line option and argument parsing.

    OpenCV2 - For accesing camera to detect real time object

    Imutils - A series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, 
             skeletonization,detecting edges etc.

     After installation open python on cmd and import tensorflow to execute your process.
    
## Final results:

Execution of this program snippet is used to find the real objects accurately by using
optical character recognition (OCR).OCR converts images of typed or handwritten text into machine-encoded text.

It uses an embedded algorithm to identify the object in the picture from the given data set and also displays the percentage of accuracy of the image that has been recognised.
